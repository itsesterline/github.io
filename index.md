Thirteen days into the SF lockdown, I thought it would be a good use of my time to build up a personal blog. Most of what I post will be useless to anyone who stumbles upon it. I don't care. This is a chance for me to spend more time working on projects and reflect on movies, sports, and books that keep me thinking about them long after I've put them down.

My goal is to update this page once a month, beginning with NFL draft thoughts (didn't I warn you this would be useless to you?) and what the Falcons might do in a few weeks.

I'll also be adding more complexity to the site, maybe do something with Cloudflare Workers down the road. Who knows.

So however you ended up here, hope you enjoy the content.

Cheers
